# CodingChallenge

Notes:

#Requires Visual Studio 2017#

If you encounter errors during build, ensure that CodingChallenge.Website is set as the default project 
and then build each project separately.

If you see errors in the API logs stating that Pixabay returned a bad-request try putting the following into the 
same browser https://pixabay.com/api/?key=12442449-35eaaf3644a88452cbb08ef10&q=separate&image_type=all&category=all&orientation=horizontal&safeSearch=true

And then try again.
